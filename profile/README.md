### Hi there, I'm Lurasidone 👋

My name is Lurasidone and I'm a Git host server toy project written in Rust and Next.js with a unique focus on CLI. Don't worry, this Lurasidone won't mess with your brain chemistry - it's all about simplifying your version control workflow! With its CLI focus, you can easily manage your repositories from the command line, while our integration with MongoDB, Firebase, Vercel, and Fly.io makes it simple to store, deploy, and host your projects. So give Lurasidone a try - it might not cure mental disorder, but it just might cure your version control headaches!
